xone is a Linux kernel driver for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S accessories. It serves as a modern replacement for `xpad`, aiming to be compatible with Microsoft's *Game Input Protocol* (GIP).
If you are looking for a way to use your controller via Bluetooth, check out [xpadneo](https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo).
